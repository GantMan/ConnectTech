You will leave this workshop fully equipped to start utilizing Elm on new projects or integrating it into existing JavaScript projects.\r\n\r\nPART 2 (afternoon) - Functional JavaScript for people who hate math\r\nUsed properly, functional programming means cleaner code, easier maintenance, and simpler testing. But most of us will never use it. Why? Because functional programming is usually explained with jargon, complex math, and some nonsense about monads or whatever. And math is hard, so most of us run away screaming. But here's the thing: functional programming doesn't actually require math. This workshop will teach you how to get the benefits of functional programming today — no math required.",
